MUI Core contains foundational React UI component libraries for shipping new features faster.

Material UI is a comprehensive library of components that features our implementation of Google's Material Design system.

Joy UI is a beautifully designed library of React UI components.

MUI Base is our library of "unstyled" components and low-level hooks. With Base, you gain complete control over your app's CSS and accessibility features.

MUI System is a collection of CSS utilities to help you rapidly lay out custom designs.

Getting started with Material UI
Here is an example of a basic app using Material UI's Button component:

import * as React from 'react';
import Button from '@mui/material/Button';

function App() {
  return <Button variant="contained">Hello World</Button>;
}
In the interactive demo below, try changing the code and see how it affects the output. (Hint: change variant to "outlined" and color to "secondary". For more options, see the Button component page in our docs.)
